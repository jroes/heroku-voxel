(The initial motivation for voxel-registry was to avoid hardcoded\nnumerical IDs, allowing blocks to be referred to across plugins by name, instead.) You can \ntranslate between IDs and names using this module (see the source for details).\n\nProperty names can be anything, but the following conventions are known:\n\n* texture: textures for rendering voxels\n* hardness: required time to mine the block, used by [voxel-mine](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-mine)\n* itemDrop: name of item to drop when block is harvested, used by [voxel-harvest](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-harvest)\n\n\nItems are registered similarly:\n\n    registry.registerItem(name, props);\n\n* itemTexture: texture for rendering in an [inventory-window](https://github.com/deathcap/inventory-window)\n* maxDamage: maximum damage before a tool breaks, used by [voxel-harvest](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-harvest), [inventory-window](https://github.com/deathcap/inventory-window)\n\nBlocks are implicitly considered items.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
